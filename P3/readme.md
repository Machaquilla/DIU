## Moodboard (diseño visual + logotipo)   
We have created a moodboard that visualizes what we want to achieve with our website. We have focused mainly on the color and the vibe that should be communicated. We want a modern vibe with a retro inspiration in the color palette, signifying our moving-forward attitude.

## Landing Page


## Mockup: LAYOUT HI-FI

## Guidelines
We have created some guidelines for a clear and structured layout of logos, buttons, and functions. Since we do not sell a product, and rather provide a non-profit service, some of the requirements (like cart, product page) and have instead specified a event calendar that should be implemented for easy accessibility of events. 

## Documentación: Publicación del Case Study
You can find the animation of our web application for a mobile phone [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/3vnQ4EaJzc1RhexS0KcqoR/DUI_3?node-id=11-1381&t=QPlgv7FMEH3hBDds-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=11%3A1381&show-proto-sidebar=1)
We have created the website of the previous practice in an improved version and adapted for mobile phone. This mainly means a changed header and layout, but we have also implemented the feedback from practice 2 to improve the overall experience.


(incluye) Valoración del equipo sobre la realización de esta práctica o los problemas surgidos
The website was adapted using the previously gained feedback. Our main concern was to increase accessibility and easy usage of the website when using a mobile phone. Therefore, we implemented a top bar. The prototyping was very handy to visualize the processes we have imagined, therefore we have found this function of figma very useful.
Our only difficulty is that we did not opt for an application layout, but rather a mobile phone layout of an internet browser.
