# DIU - Practica 3, entregables

## Moodboard (diseño visual + logotipo)   
We have created a moodboard that visualizes what we want to achieve with our website. We have focused mainly on the color and the vibe that should be communicated. We want a modern vibe with a retro inspiration in the color palette, signifying our moving-forward attitude.

## Landing Page
The landing page is an important part of the website and shows the main functionality. In our case, the landing page will be used to show our most popular recurring event, the Alhambra tour. This tour happens weekly and is a great entry point into the community. 
A central button in our primary color also offers a direct link to all other upcoming events, leading participants into the event calendar.

## Mockup: LAYOUT HI-FI / PROTOTYPE
You can find the animation of our web application for a mobile phone [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/3vnQ4EaJzc1RhexS0KcqoR/DUI_3?node-id=11-1381&t=QPlgv7FMEH3hBDds-1&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=0%3A1&starting-point-node-id=11%3A1381&show-proto-sidebar=1). We have focused on the main usage of our website, which is informing possibly interested persons and signing up users to our events. Since we have multiple walking events per week, a specified page for signing up and for canceling signed up events has been developed. Additionally, we have focused on a clear presentation of our most famous events and on our FAQ, since we are a non-profit organization and possible interested persons might have a lot of questions about our working procedures. In our prototype we have shown the main functionalities: signing up for an account, informing about events; signing up for events or cancelling the participation. For all of these functions, the easy navigation using the top menu bar is vital. The Logo serves as a shortcut back to the home menu and allows for easy switching between events.

## Guidelines
We have created some guidelines for a clear and structured layout of logos, buttons, and functions. Since we do not sell a product, and rather provide a non-profit service, some of the requirements (like cart, product page) and have instead specified an event calendar that should be implemented for easy accessibility of events. 

## Documentación: Publicación del Case Study

We have created the website of the previous practice in an improved version and adapted for mobile phone. This mainly means a changed header and layout, but we have also implemented the feedback from practice 2 to improve the overall experience. In addition to the prototype, we will append photos of the app pages that show the main functionalities.


### Valoración del equipo sobre la realización de esta práctica o los problemas surgidos

The website was adapted using the previously gained feedback. Our main concern was to increase accessibility and easy usage of the website when using a mobile phone. Therefore, we implemented a top bar. The prototyping was very handy to visualize the processes we have imagined, therefore we have found this function of figma very useful.
Our only difficulty is that we did not opt for an application layout, but rather a mobile phone layout of an internet browser.
