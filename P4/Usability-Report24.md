### Realizado por:

This report has been done by the Team Charlotte and Juanma (los Borrachos). We have assessed the COOK IT! website and identified and evaluated the underlying concept.











## 1 DESCRIPCIÓN DEL WEBSITE

COOK IT! is an app that aims to provide culinary experiences to its users. It offers cooking classes and other culinary events, ranging to wine tastings and multiple cultural culinary experiences. The aim of the website is to create a community of food lovers, giving them to share and receive inspiration for their passion.

 



## 2 RESUMEN EJECUTIVO

In this practica, we have learned to adapt a concept into an app that is usable for its demographic. In this document we will assess the tests we have done to evaluate the app and its functionalities.




## 3 METODOLOGIA 

#### Metodología de usabililidad

In this practica, we began with two web design proposals: our Proposal A a Proposal B that was assigned to us. We have evaluated the project of group B (COOK IT!). We have constructed a test with two potential users, and they were asked to fill out a System Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire to evaluate usability. The goal was to determine the better option based on the collected data.

The practica contained multiple sub-assignments:

1. During the practicum session, Case B was assigned for co-evaluation. The design was accessible via a web link. We were assigned COOK IT!, a web app designated to connect food lovers to different culinary events.
   
2.We used Gaze Recorder to create an eye-tracking experiment. This involved:
   - Introducing images of the prototypes to users.
   - Recruiting users for the study, which could be conducted in-person or remotely (via a link).
   - Providing minimal instructions for each image of the app, with either providing the subject with a question to investigate the image with, or allow for free exploration.
   - Identifying at least one Area of Interest (AOI) per sketch for user recognition, with a suggested viewing time of 4-6 seconds per image. In our case, the Areas of Interest always corresponded with the buttons that the subject had to find to complete the task we have asked them to solve. 
   
3. We were asked to conduct two experiemnts and analyze the resulting heat maps to find significant differences between the designed tasks and the users' focus areas.
Secondly, we started comparing the responses of an expert user (from the design team) with those of two target users to highlight differences.
   
4. Each user completed a SUS questionnaire for the assigned application. This perceptual test was used to calculate the SUS score, and preferences between Proposal A and Proposal B were discussed in the usability report. The score obtained for COOK IT! showed an overall positive user perception, with the two final scores both corresponding to ACEPTABLE TIPO C (GOOD 70-80).


The findings from the A/B testing and the usability checklist were summarized in this Usability Report for Team B (COOK IT!), concluding with an evaluation of the usability of Team B's design. 
This structured approach ensured a thorough usability evaluation through practical user interaction and objective analysis, ultimately guiding the design improvement process.

#### Resultados obtenidos



The document contains a user study aiming to assess the usability of the website. In order to evaluate the app, we have asked two potential users for their evaluation. We have chosen as participants one male and one female user, with different levels of experience in the field of application design. Both users liked the website and stated that they could see themselves use it regularly. They also stressed that the functionalities of the website were well integrated. The only critical point they have assessed was that not every user would find the website very easy to use and will understand quickly how it works. However, the users still gave 3 out of 5 points for this category, meaning that even though there is room for improvement, they still saw the foundation for success in this regard.

We have also conducted two different tasks for the users to assess using GazeRecorder. In both cases, we have asked the users a minimal task, and recorded their gaze as they observed the app.

GAZE TASK 1:
Image shown: Shopping cart containing two items.
Question asked: Please identify what you can do in this view of the app.
![Gaze Task 1](https://github.com/Machaquilla/DIU/blob/master/P4/gaze_task_1.png)

GAZE TASK 2:
Image shown: Specific course view.
Question asked: How clear is the purpose of this event?
![Gaze Task 2](https://github.com/Machaquilla/DIU/blob/master/P4/gaze_task_2.png)


Due to hardware constraints, we were only able to perform the viewing tasks once. We will evaluate the heatmaps of our test subject.

GAZE TASK 1 RESULT:

GAZE TASK 2 RESULT:

![Heatmap 2](https://github.com/Machaquilla/DIU/blob/master/P4/heatmap_task_2.png)

In the heatmaps shown above, it is visible that the subject has quickly identified the most relevant parts of the app. In the first heatmap, the image on top of the site draws attention, together with the bold headline. The text is shortly examined and the focus shifts to the Chef as well, that will be present on the event. The app is constructed in a way that allows the user to quickly identify the purpose of the activity.

In the second heatmap, the shopping cart is displayed. Attention is specifically drawn to the items in the cart, as well as the presented button on the bottom of the page used to complete the shopping process. A third area of interest is the icons on the top of the display, which indicates that the color and icon choice is complementary with the shopping cart design.


## 4 CONCLUSIONES 


We have assessed the COOK IT! app, and with regard to the experimental designs, it demonstrates high usability. The user interface is intuitive and user-friendly, making it easy for users of different experience levels to navigate the app. The feedback from users indicates a positive overall experience, highlighting the app’s effective layout and clear instructions. The usability testing confirms that COOK IT! meets the primary needs of its users, providing a seamless and enjoyable interaction. This high usability is crucial for user retention and satisfaction, ensuring the app remains competitive in the market. The idea of the app is very interesting and could provide a previouly untapped market with a nice app.
The eye tracking results reveal that users quickly identified key elements of the app. In the first heatmap, users focused on the top image and bold headline, briefly examined the text, and then noticed the featured Chef. This indicates that the app's design effectively communicates the event's purpose. In the second heatmap, attention was directed towards the shopping cart items and the checkout button at the bottom of the page. Users also noticed the icons at the top of the display, suggesting that the app's color scheme and iconography complement the shopping cart design, enhancing usability and visual appeal.


#### Incidencias

The SUS resulted in very good marks. However, we were unfortunately unable to conduct heat map testing due to camera specifications that our hardware was not fulfilling. 


#### Valoración 

The COOK IT! app has several positive aspects worth highlighting. The app's design is aesthetically pleasing, with a clean layout and vibrant colors that make it visually appealing. It is visible that the designers took into account what was discussed in the classes.


#### Recomendaciones y propuesta de mejoras: 

For a smooth usage from all experience levels, a light version for older people would be interesting. This way, only the primary functionalities would be shown to users who might otherwise be overwhelmed with an app. This could increase the range of users even further.







#### Valoración de la prueba de usabilidad (self-assesment)

We have enjoyed to evaluate the app and have appreciated the clear and structured design. The process of constructing an experiment and asking subjects to evaluate the prototype was very interesting and gave us a lot of insight into the design and verification process.
